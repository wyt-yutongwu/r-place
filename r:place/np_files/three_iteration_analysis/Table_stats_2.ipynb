The original area extended over the One Piece area to the north, but the French were happy to offer up the space to r/OnePiece during the final day, and even helped them build their art.\n",

The French Twitch community valiantly rallied and succeeded in retaking the north area; they then resisted until very late into the night, but their numbers ended up dwindling dangerously as people left to sleep.\n",

      "While the late night/early morning crew did their best (French streamers relayed each other around the clock), The Eiffel Tower was completely dismantled and the flag almost entirely disappeared under the onslaught. North American streamer xQc then led an initiative to draw a gigantic version of 2B's ass (a Nier: Automata character). Work was well underway when Reddit moderation intervened to black out the ass several times.\n",
      "\n",
      "As people in France woke up, The early morning French streamers and their community, along with r/placefrance, were able to slowly clean up and retake most of the area. They first focused on redoing the flag, Then added the Arc de Triomphe model on the bottom (which ended up promptly taken over by a legion of Among Us crewmates); the Zidane face, croissant and dofus eggs came next. As more and more people woke up on the French side, French streamers congregated and debated over what other art to add. Some art that was drawn but didn't end up making the cut: Rayman (on the right of the Arc de Triomphe), a carte vitale (national health card), and Mr. Mime (around where Remy from Ratatouille is).\n",
      "\n",
      "The French Twitch community resisted against a number of assaults during the day, notably on Zidane's face and the Arc de Triomphe. Bangtan Sonyeondan fans also tried to plaster the logo in the upper half, without success. The French steadily kept defending and building numerous new piece of arts such as the Louvre, Jinx, Lofi Girl, Remy, etc. until the late afternoon to evening, when the Spanish streamers came back in force to try and destroy their work once more. They again allied with North American streamers such as xQc and Erobb, drawing a huge BTS logo where Zidane's face was.\n",
      "\n",
      "The French streamers once again rallied all together (there were more than 600k viewers on French streams, 400k of them following the \"French general\" Kamet0) to defend and rebuild, along with smaller communities which helped from the shadows such as r/OnePiece. The French Twitch community decided to focus their defense efforts on the flag itself, Thinking that it was easier than trying to rebuild all art at the same time, which meant that while only Thomas Pesquet and the Arc de Triomphe were mostly left standing at the end, The French flag was still there and going strong at the end or r/place.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the end, The French area, which was focused by hundreds of thousands by people, ended up being the first one to disappear; when French streamers understood that the great white-out had come, They then rallied to try and write \"FR\" or \"FRA\" in white on the canvas. \n",
